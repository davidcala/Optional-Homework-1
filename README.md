Optional-Homework 1

PACKT editor releases each day a different free book on its webpage, we want
to know, each morning, the title of the book, so we can decide if we want to
download it or not.

The webpage is: https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning/

The goal is to build a simple python application, using the following libraries:
• urllib2
• BeautifulSoup4
To scrape some text, namely the book title, from the webpage, and print it
(with the ultimate goal of using any notification method to send the user the
information).
The code uses the subprocess in order to have a notification in the screen and I also write the code to send a Telegram message if you have a Telegram bot.
